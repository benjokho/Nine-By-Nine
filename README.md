# Nine-By-Nine
3x3 by 3x3 tictactoe

This is my first multiplatform game that I've put on the Google Play Store. I'm rebuilding it since my computer crashed, losing all my code (hence why I've unpublished the game for the time being) and only now have started using GitHub as backup.

The game is essentially a clone of a game my classmates and I used to play, which is 9 normal tictactoe games put together into one huge game. I'll explain later.
